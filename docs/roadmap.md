## Phase 7 — Audio

| # | Item | What | Files | Effort | Blocker |
|---|------|------|-------|--------|---------|
| 7.1 | **Audio multi-segment muxing** | Concatenate multiple audio files via ffmpeg into final output. Support per-scene audio tracks. | `export/ffmpeg.rs` | 3 days | — |

---

## Phase 8 — Agent / NL Integration

| # | Item | What | Files | Effort | Blocker |
|---|------|------|-------|--------|---------|
| 8.1 | **NL command bar dispatch** | Send NL input to an external AI service, parse structured response into `Command` queue. | `app/shell/nl_command_bar.rs`, `app/commands.rs` | 1 week | External AI service |
| 8.2 | **Agent suggestion UI** | Inline suggestion widget that proposes edits (e.g. "Add fade-in to Circle_1"). User accepts/rejects with keyboard shortcut. | `app/components/agent_suggestions.rs` | 3 days | 8.1 |

---

## Phase 9 — Editor Infrastructure

| # | Item | What | Files | Effort | Blocker |
|---|------|------|-------|--------|---------|
| 9.1 | **Green tree (rowan)** | Immutable syntax tree with cheap clones. Enables lossless source manipulation, reliable formatting, and incremental parsing. | New crate `animatix-green` | 2–3 months | Stable syntax |
| 9.2 | **Trivia-inspired AST** | Whitespace and comment preservation in AST. Enables formatter and non-destructive edits. | `animatix-green/` | 2–3 months | 9.1 |
| 9.3 | **Web canvas / WASM** | Alternative renderer backend for browser export. Uses same timeline but renders to HTML canvas or WebGPU. | New crate `animatix-web` | Very high | Alternative renderer |

## Order

1. **Phase 7** (audio — no blockers)
2. **Phase 8** (external AI service required)
3. **Phase 9** (start after syntax stabilizes)

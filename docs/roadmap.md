# Animatix Roadmap

> Forward-looking view of known gaps, planned features, and deferred work.
> For the current language surface, see [`spec.md`](spec.md). For architecture, see [`architecture.md`](architecture.md).
> For design specifications, see [`design/gui-redesign-2026.md`](design/gui-redesign-2026.md).

## Phase 7 — Audio

| # | Item | What | Files | Effort | Blocker |
|---|------|------|-------|--------|---------|
| 7.1 | **Audio multi-segment muxing** | Concatenate multiple audio files via ffmpeg into final output. Support per-scene audio tracks. | `export/ffmpeg.rs` | 3 days | — |

---

## Phase 8 — PiP / Multi-Viewport

> **Deferred.** The current viewport system has been removed. PiP will be implemented as an actor-level `Scene` primitive, not statement-level declarations.

| # | Item | What | Files | Effort | Blocker |
|---|------|------|-------|--------|---------|
| 8.1 | **Design `Scene` primitive** | Actor type whose content is another scene's timeline. Position, size, opacity are animatable properties (keyframes). `scene` property names the scene to render. | `primitives/`, `timeline/track.rs` | 3 days | Stable syntax |
| 8.2 | **Scene reference rendering** | Renderer evaluates referenced scene timeline at current time, clips to actor bounds, transforms to actor position, applies actor opacity. | `timeline/scene_eval.rs`, `renderer/` | 1 week | 8.1 |
| 8.3 | **Inspector + timeline support** | Scene actors show up in timeline tracks, inspector panel, and gizmo selection like any other actor. | `app/panels/` | 3 days | 8.2 |

---

## Phase 9b — Core Architecture Refactors (deferred from cleanup)

> Structural improvements discovered during Phase 9. These are large, risky changes
> that need dedicated testing time. Do not mix with feature work.

| # | Item | What | Files | Effort | Blocker |
|---|------|------|-------|--------|---------|
| 9b.3 | **Atomic source edit validation** | `handle_keyframe_edit` applies the edit to the timeline *before* validating the source round-trip. A failed round-trip leaves timeline and source text out of sync. Restructure to validate first, then apply atomically. | `actions/mod.rs` | 2–3 days | — |

---

## Phase 10 — Editor Infrastructure

| # | Item | What | Files | Effort | Blocker |
|---|------|------|-------|--------|---------|
| 10.1 | **Green tree (rowan)** | Immutable syntax tree with cheap clones. Enables lossless source manipulation, reliable formatting, and incremental parsing. | New crate `animatix-green` | 2–3 months | Stable syntax |
| 10.2 | **Trivia-inspired AST** | Whitespace and comment preservation in AST. Enables formatter and non-destructive edits. | `animatix-green/` | 2–3 months | 10.1 |
| 10.3 | **Web canvas / WASM** | Alternative renderer backend for browser export. Uses same timeline but renders to HTML canvas or WebGPU. | New crate `animatix-web` | Very high | Alternative renderer |

---

## Order

1. **Phase 7** (audio — no blockers)
2. **Phase 8** (PiP — after syntax and renderer are stable)
3. **Phase 10** (start after syntax stabilizes)

---

## Deferred (not on critical path)

| Item | Why deferred | Likely phase |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| `animatix-cli lint` / `format` | Requires trivia-aware AST (Phase 10 / green tree) | 10 |
| `let` variable animation | Superseded by easing functions in `always` blocks (6.8.3). Keyframed `let` tracks would need new timeline infrastructure; `always` lerp covers the same use cases statelessly. | Post-10 |
| **AI / NL Integration** | Requires external AI service (OpenAI, Claude, local LLM). No runtime dependency on AI should be mandatory. Includes: NL command bar, agent suggestion UI, agent_suggestions component. | Post-10 or separate product |
| **Row double-click / right-click** | No defined user story. Fields were wired to egui events but no caller consumed them. Re-add when a feature needs them. | When needed |
| **Badge button component** | Fully implemented but no caller. Re-add when the UI needs count badges (e.g. "Errors: 3"). | When needed |
| **Pre-compile plot closures** | Compile `func` AST bodies to closures/bytecode once per build instead of tree-walking thousands of times per curve. Would give 10–50× sampling speedup but requires a stable closure compilation API. | Post-10 or when plot count becomes a bottleneck again |
